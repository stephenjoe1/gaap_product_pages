      </div>
        <div class="column-two-thirds">
              <p>GOV.UK Pay builds technical integrations with payment service providers to make it simple for services across central government to take online payments. It will also reduce processing costs for government.</p>

              <p>GOV.UK Pay will do the hard work of building technical integrations with a number of leading payment service providers so that individual services donâ€™t have to.</p>

              <p>This will:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>make it simpler, easier and faster for government services to start taking payments</li>
                <li>give government teams more options to take online payments, including credit and debit cards</li>
                <li>increase efficiency in government payment processing by reducing the need for manual payment processing</li>
                <li>make it easier for teams to reconcile payments and issue refunds</li>
